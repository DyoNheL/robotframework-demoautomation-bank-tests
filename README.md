## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Python

* Download Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* During installation, **check “Add Python to PATH”**.

Check installation:

```bash
python --version
```

---

### 2. Google Chrome

* Download and install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

---

### 3. Required Python Libraries

Open terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This installs Robot Framework, SeleniumLibrary, and other dependencies needed to run the tests.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP and extract it.
2. Install Python, Chrome, and required Python libraries (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

---

## Running the Tests

Open terminal in the project folder and execute:

```bash
robot BankingApp.robot
```
> This will run **all test cases** in the suite (Customer + Manager flows).

To run only a specific test file:

```bash
robot tests/test_customer_flow.robot
```
> To run customer flow


```bash
robot tests/test_manager_flow.robot
```
> To run manager flow


---

## Viewing Test Reports

After execution, Robot Framework generates reports in `docs/reports/`:

```
Customer Flow
  ├── log_customer.html        # Step-by-step log for Customer flow
  ├── report_customer.html     # Summary report for Customer flow
  └── output_customer.xml      # Machine-readable output

Manager Flow
  ├── log_manager.html         # Step-by-step log for Manager flow
  ├── report_manager.html      # Summary report for Manager flow
  └── output_manager.xml       # Machine-readable output

All Tests
  ├── log_all.html             # Detailed log for all tests
  ├── report_all.html          # Summary report for all tests
  └── output_all.xml           # Machine-readable output
```

> `log.html` contains step-by-step execution details and screenshots (if included) for easy debugging.

## Troubleshooting

* **Browser does not open:** Ensure Google Chrome is installed and updated.
* **`robot` command not recognized:** Check Python PATH or activate virtual environment.
* **SeleniumLibrary errors:** Make sure `webdriver-manager` is installed.

---

## Tips for New Users

* Always check `docs/reports/` to review results and screenshots.
* Start by running **Customer flow** first to get familiar with the tests.
* Use `--loglevel DEBUG` when running Robot Framework to see detailed console output:

```bash
robot --loglevel DEBUG BankingApp.robot
```
